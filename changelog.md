# Loaded edition v2.1
Moved "four big guys" sound to the trade menu to make it less conspicuous.

# Version 2.0
Fixed an issue in my file names that prevented the Loaded edition from working in 1.20.1.  Re-arranged the internal structure of all editions to use a custom namespace instead of shoehorning my .ogg files into the minecraft namespace.  Now, the minecraft namespace has nothing in it but the sounds.json file.

# Loaded edition beta 0.1

I was going to wait until the clips that I took from my last round of snipping were fully added, but there are over 400 more of them, and I'd kind of also like to get some feedback on what's already been added, so here's the first beta version of the new edition!

# Version 3.0
---
All sounds are now distance-dependent and directional.

# Initial Github Version (v2.2)
---
This version is at half original volume, to better match the villager sound level in Minecraft.
