# fhb-villager-sounds

This is a Minecraft resource pack containing villager sounds featuring Twitch streamer FlyingHawkButt.

This came about during a livestream in which Hawkie was bragging that she could sound just like the villagers in Minecraft, and *demanded* that someone "put [her] in the ... game."

So I did.

Ever since then, I've had so much fun putting this together, I can't stop.

Please send help.

## How to install
1. In Minecraft's main menu, click "Options"
2. Click "Resource Packs."
3. At the bottom of the screen that appears, click "Open Pack Folder."
4. Drop this zip file into this folder using your file manager and then return to Minecraft.  You should see the pack in the list at the left side of the screen (Available)
5. Click the arrow on the pack to move it to the right side of the screen (Selected)
6. Click "Done" and play the game.

## How to hear all the sounds
All the sounds are random in their context, so you may need to try multiple times to hear them all.  Also, the game pitch-shifts the sounds, so they can sound kind of different, even if they're not.  Be patient.

* Find a village.  Just hanging around the inhabitants, you should hear them make various idle sounds.

* Right-click on a villager with a profession to enter the villager's trading menu.  Do nothing, just wait.  You should hear various "haggle" sounds while you are in this menu.

* Try to trade an item that the villager will *not* accept.  You should hear various "no" sounds.  You can also hear these "no" sounds if you try to trade with a villager who has no profession.

* Trade an item that the villager *does* accept.  You should hear various "yes" sounds.  They should also make these sounds when you win a raid.

* Take out a sword and attack the villager.  You should hear several "hit" sounds.  I wouldn't recommend doing this in survival mode, as the village's Iron Golem will want to have words with you.  FlyingHawkButt F&@%ed-around and found out the first time she tried this pack.

* When the villager finally dies, you should hear one or more (depending on edition) spectacular "death" sound(s).

## Editions
### Original
This was the original, built quickly based on Hawkie's attempt to imitate the villager sounds.  It came together just in time for a special livestream in which FlyingHawkButt joined CarlCrafts' mod team in their attempt to defeat the Ender Dragon.  The sheer hilarity that ensued was quite the experience.

It has a total of 17 sounds: 1 death, 3 haggle, 4 hit, 3 idle, 3 no, and 3 yes

### Loaded
This edition will have all the original sounds, plus as many more as I can pack in there.  I discovered how to include more than the default number of sounds, so you'd better believe I'm doing that.

This edition has x sounds: x death, x haggle, x hit, x idle, x no and x yes

### Profane
Wherever possible in this edition, the sound event contains profanity.  She is Australian, after-all...

This edition is still in progress

### UwU
This edition aims to be as adorable as possible, with giggles and laughter and benevolent good vibes, because Hawkie is absolutely adorable in every way.

I am still working on this one
