# fhb-villager-sounds

This is a Minecraft resource pack containing villager sounds featuring Twitch streamer FlyingHawkButt.

This came about during a livestream in which Hawkie was bragging that she could sound just like the villagers in Minecraft, and *demanded* that someone "put [her] in the ... game."

So I did.

## How to install
1. In Minecraft's main menu, click "Options"
2. Click "Resource Packs."
3. At the bottom of the screen that appears, click "Open Pack Folder."
4. Drop this zip file into this folder using your file manager and then return to Minecraft.  You should see the pack in the list at the left side of the screen (Available)
5. Click the arrow on the pack to move it to the right side of the screen (Selected)
6. Click "Done" and play the game.

## How to hear all the sounds (based on the original edition)
All the sounds are random in their context, so you may need to wait a while to hear them all.  Also, the game pitch-shifts the sounds, so they kind of sound different, even if they're not.  Be patient.

* Find a village, and a villager who has a profession.  Just hanging around them, you should hear them make 3 different sounds that Hawkie  deliberately made to imitate villagers on her live stream.

* Right-click on the villager to enter the villager's trading menu.  Do nothing, just wait.  You should hear 3 different "haggle" sounds while you are in this menu.

* Try to trade an item that the villager will *not* accept.  You should hear 3 different "no" sounds.  You can also hear these "no" sounds if you try to trade with a villager who has no profession.

* Trade an item that the villager *does* accept.  You should hear 3 different "yes" sounds.

* Take out a sword and attack the villager.  You should hear 4 different "hit" sounds.  I wouldn't recommend doing this in survival mode, as the village's Iron Golem will want to have words with you.

* When the villager finally dies, you should hear the spectacular "death" sound.

## Editions
### Original
This was the original, built quickly based on Hawkie's attempt to imitate the villager sounds.  It came together just in time for a special livestream in which FlyingHawkButt joined CarlCrafts' mod team in their attempt to defeat the Ender Dragon.

It has a total of 17 sounds: 1 death, 3 haggle, 4 hit, 3 idle, 3 no, and 3 yes

### Loaded
This edition will have all the original sounds, plus as many more as I can pack in there.  I discovered how to include more than the default number of sounds, so you'd better believe I'm doing that.

This edition has x sounds: x death, x haggle, x hit, x idle, x no and x yes

### non-pc
Wherever possible in this edition, the sound event will contain profanity.  She is Australian, after-all...

### UwU
This edition aims to be as adorable as possible, with giggles and laughter and benevolent good vibes, because Hawkie is absolutely adorable in every way.
